# Market-segmentation
A machine learning based project on market segmentation

# Overview

This project focuses on market segmentation using data analysis and machine learning techniques to identify distinct customer segments. The insights gained from this project can help in tailoring marketing strategies to different customer groups, enhancing customer satisfaction, and boosting business growth.
### Data Description : 
The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.

### Model Training:
The model is trained using unsupervised learning techniques, primarily K-Means clustering. The following steps outline the training process:

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
Model selection: Choosing the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
Training: Applying the K-Means algorithm to identify customer segments.
### Results
The results of the market segmentation are stored in the results directory. This includes the segmented data and visualizations of the clusters.

Cluster Analysis: A detailed analysis of each identified cluster.
Visualizations: Graphs and charts showing the distribution of clusters.
